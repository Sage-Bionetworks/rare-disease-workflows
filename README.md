# rare-disease-workflows
Workflows for processing rare disease data on Synapse.

The goal of this repository is to faciliate harmonization across rare-disease datasets that are deposited onto [Synapse](http://synapse.org). These workflows will be centered around various stages of analysis, shown below.

## Data Harmonization workflows
We have built a number of workflows that re-process raw data uploaded to Synapse to create a single data repository.

| Data Type | Description | Location | Destination
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
RNA-Seq | This workflow runs | (rna-seq-workflow) | [Synapse Table]()
Exome/WGS-Seq | test | test| i hate md tables |
Drug-Sensitivity Data | Thsi does great things | (drug-screening-workflow)

As more data types are added we will continue to add more workflows. 

## Analysis workflows
Moving forward we aim to standardize
