# rare-disease-workflows
Workflows for processing rare disease data on Synapse.

The goal of this repository is to faciliate harmonization across rare-disease datasets that are deposited onto [Synapse](http://synapse.org). These workflows will be centered around various stages of analysis, shown below.

## Data Harmonization workflows
We have built a number of workflows that re-process raw data uploaded to Synapse to create a single data repository.
| Data Type | Description | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
RNA-Seq | This workflow runs | (rna-seq-workflow|
Exome-Seq | test | test|
